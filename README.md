# Beeptionary
An Official Unofficial Dictionary of Beeps

## Contributing
Contributing is really easy.
You just need to open [index.html](index.html) and then you can press the little ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86181082/122671595-47602300-d1e9-11eb-8b60-398c79813869.png) button to open a file editor.

Each `<li>` element is 1 word. So basically just add another `<li></li>` tag. And put a word with translation in it.

After that press "Propose Changes" button, when you did it, all is left - is just to press "Create Pull Request" button.

When you create a pull request, it will be queued for a review. If we think that the word is good, we will add it to the Beeptionary.

### Example
`<li>Beep - Pog</li>`
